  The Provident Fund is a welfare scheme for the benefits of the employees. Both employer and employee contribute their share of the amount, but the whole of the amount is deposited by the employer. The employer deducts the employee share from the salary of the employee. So, the accumulated amount can be withdrawn if certain conditions are met. Employees Provident Fund was established in the year 1952.
  
  ### Scheme Functioning ###

  Under the EPF scheme, employers and employees both contribute to the EPF account every month. However, it is the responsibility of the employer to deposit the entire amount in the EPF account. The employee's EPF share is deducted from their monthly salary.
  
  For all EPF transfers, an employee needs to have  a UAN(Universal Account Number), which is issued by EPFO. The UAN is allotted to an individual under which an employer makes all necessary payments. Its mandatory to have Aadhar linked with UAN, else no payments are possible.
