Short Term Employment Contract are another form of Fixed Term Employent Contract and it differs only in the single fact that period of contract is less than one year. These Contracts are typically Project based and have strict timelines. Any contract longer than a year, the employee rights change to similar terms as in a Fixed Term Contract that has different benefits compared to short term

### Benefits

These contracts enjoy same benefits as described in [Fixed Term](/docs/Fixed-Term) Contracts

One key difference is due to short period of employment, Employers can avoid conversion of Fixed Term Employees to Permanent Employees. 

Secondly, the employer can terminate employment without much hassles as the Contract needs to specify Project and time, so once either ends or employee fails evaluation, it can be ended with a week's notice

Employees generally charge higher premium compared to Fixed Term Contracts, so for those whose skill sets are in high demand, they can work on short stints while being able to adjust their pay as per current market demand.

Most other terms remains same as in [Fixed Term](/docs/Fixed-Term) Contracts
